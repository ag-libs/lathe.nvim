-- neotest adapter for Lathe (requires https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest).
--
-- Installation: alongside require('lathe').setup(), configure neotest with this adapter:
--   require('neotest').setup({ adapters = { require('lathe.neotest') } })
--
-- Discovery and execution both go through the already-running Lathe LSP server rather
-- than spawning Maven or a treesitter-query scan: discover_positions calls
-- lathe.runnables.list (real attributed-analysis discovery, not syntax guessing), and
-- build_spec calls lathe.run.test synchronously via nio.lsp, replaying from captured
-- .lathe/ bytecode -- no Maven invocation, no recompilation. build_spec is not declared
-- async but neotest always invokes it from inside TestRunner:run_tree's async chain, so
-- a yielding nio.lsp call inside it is valid.

-- Required lazily (inside functions, not here at module load) so that
-- `require('lathe.neotest')` itself never fails when neotest/nio aren't on
-- the runtimepath -- this file must stay loadable, including by tests that
-- exercise its pure logic, on any machine that doesn't have the optional
-- neotest plugin installed.
